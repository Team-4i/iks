# GamifiEd - Learning Meets Fun! 🚀

## 🎯 Overview

Traditional education often feels dull, making it hard for students to stay engaged. GamifiEd transforms learning into an interactive adventure, helping students learn, revise, and test through fun challenges while easing the burden on institutions. By integrating gamification into the learning process, students stay motivated and retain knowledge more effectively.

## 🕹 How It Works

GamifiEd structures educational content into levels, where students advance by playing interactive games. Each game is designed to reinforce learning in a fun and engaging manner. Points are awarded based on performance, and students can track their progress through leaderboards. Institutions can configure grading methods and track individual and group performance metrics.
