# GamifiEd - Learning Meets Fun! üöÄ

## üéØ Overview

Traditional education often feels dull, making it hard for students to stay engaged. GamifiEd transforms learning into an interactive adventure, helping students learn, revise, and test through fun challenges while easing the burden on institutions. By integrating gamification into the learning process, students stay motivated and retain knowledge more effectively.

## üïπ How It Works

GamifiEd structures educational content into levels, where students advance by playing interactive games. Each game is designed to reinforce learning in a fun and engaging manner. Points are awarded based on performance, and students can track their progress through leaderboards. Institutions can configure grading methods and track individual and group performance metrics.

# üéÆ Key Game Modes

Players answer questions to advance through the board.

Correct answers move the player forward, while incorrect ones trigger setbacks like moving backward or facing additional challenges.

        }

}
```

## Important Notes

1. All question types must include:
   - `type` field (MCQ, FILL, MATCH, TF, ODD, CAT, or SCRAMBLE)
   - `question` field with the question text

2. Field Requirements:
   - Text fields should be strings
   - Arrays should contain strings
   - Boolean values in TF questions should be strings ("true" or "false")
   - All fields marked as "Optional" can be omitted

3. Best Practices:
   - Keep questions clear and concise
   - Provide appropriate hints when helpful
   - Ensure all answers are unambiguous
   - For MCQ, provide 3-4 options
   - For MATCH and CAT, provide at least 3 pairs/items
   - For SCRAMBLE, ensure scrambled word is different from correct word
